# Planning Agent Separation Summary

## Overview
Successfully separated the planning agent execution logic from the orchestration engine, creating a cleaner architecture where the planning agent has its own dedicated executor.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Planning Agent Executor
**New File: `controllers/planning_agent/executor.py`**
- Contains `process_alert_with_planning()` function (moved from orchestration engine)
- Contains `run_planning_scenarios()` function (moved from orchestration engine)
- Contains `main()` function for standalone execution
- Can be run directly: `python controllers/planning_agent/executor.py`

### 2. Removed Planning Logic from Orchestration Engine
**Modified: `orchestration_engine/orchestrator.py`**
- Removed `process_alert_with_planning()` function
- Removed `run_planning_scenarios()` function
- Removed planning-specific imports (`PlanningAgentOutputSchema`)
- Removed `--planning` mode from main execution
- Now focuses purely on core orchestration functionality

### 3. Separated Planning Schemas
**New File: `controllers/planning_agent/planner_schemas.py`**
- Moved `PlanStepSchema` from orchestration engine
- Moved `SimplePlanSchema` from orchestration engine
- Moved `PlanningAgentInputSchema` from orchestration engine
- Moved `PlanningAgentOutputSchema` from orchestration engine
- Planning agent now has its own dedicated schemas

**Modified: `orchestration_engine/schemas/orchestrator_schemas.py`**
- Removed all planning-related schemas
- Now contains only core orchestration schemas
- Clean separation between engine and planning concerns

**Modified: `orchestration_engine/schemas/__init__.py`**
- Removed planning schema exports
- Orchestration engine no longer exposes planning schemas

### 4. Updated Package Exports
**Modified: `orchestration_engine/__init__.py`**
- Removed `process_alert_with_planning` from exports
- Orchestration engine now exports only core functionality

**Modified: `controllers/planning_agent/__init__.py`**
- Added exports for `process_alert_with_planning` and `run_planning_scenarios`
- Added exports for all planning schemas (`PlanStepSchema`, `SimplePlanSchema`, etc.)
- Planning agent now provides complete planning interface including schemas

### 4. Updated Example Usage
**Modified: `example_usage.py`**
- Now imports `process_alert_with_planning` from `controllers.planning_agent`
- Simplified to use the new executor interface

## Architecture Benefits

### Clear Separation of Concerns
- **Orchestration Engine**: Pure execution engine, no planning-specific logic
- **Planning Agent**: Complete planning workflow with its own executor

### Improved Modularity
- Planning agent can be developed and tested independently
- Orchestration engine is more focused and reusable
- Each component has a single responsibility

### Better Dependency Flow
```
controllers/planning_agent/executor.py → orchestration_engine/
```
The planning executor uses the orchestration engine, not the other way around.

## Usage Examples

### Running the Planning Agent Directly
```bash
# Run the planning agent with example scenarios
python controllers/planning_agent/executor.py
```

### Using the Planning Agent Programmatically
```python
from controllers.planning_agent import process_alert_with_planning

# Process a single alert
result = process_alert_with_planning(
    alert="High CPU usage detected",
    context="Production environment"
)
```

### Using the Orchestration Engine Independently
```bash
# Run the core orchestration engine
python orchestration_engine/orchestrator.py
```

## File Structure
```
controllers/planning_agent/
├── __init__.py              # Exports planning functions and schemas
├── simple_agent.py          # Core planning logic
├── executor.py              # Planning execution pipeline
└── planner_schemas.py       # Planning-specific schemas

orchestration_engine/
├── __init__.py              # Core engine exports
├── orchestrator.py          # Pure orchestration logic
├── schemas/                 # Core orchestration schemas only
├── utils/                   # Core utilities
├── agents/                  # Execution agents
└── tools/                   # Available tools
```

## Verification
✅ Planning functions removed from orchestration engine
✅ Planning executor works independently
✅ Orchestration engine focuses on core functionality
✅ Planning schemas moved to dedicated file
✅ Schema imports updated throughout codebase
✅ Clean separation between engine and planning schemas
✅ Clean import structure maintained
✅ All tests pass

## Next Steps
1. **Run Planning Agent**: `python controllers/planning_agent/executor.py`
2. **Create New Controllers**: Follow the same pattern in `controllers/`
3. **Extend Planning**: Add new planning strategies in `controllers/planning_agent/`
4. **Use Orchestration Engine**: Import from `orchestration_engine` for new controllers

The separation successfully achieves the goal of removing planning-specific logic from the orchestration engine while maintaining all functionality in a more organized structure.
