# Orchestration Agent Refactor Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the project structure to separate the reusable orchestration engine from high-level controllers, creating a cleaner architecture with better separation of concerns.

## Changes Made

### 1. Directory Structure Reorganization
```
Before:
orchestration_agent/
├── orchestrator.py
├── planning/
│   └── simple_agent.py
├── agents/
├── tools/
├── utils/
└── schemas/

After:
orchestration_engine/          # Reusable execution engine
├── orchestrator.py
├── agents/
├── tools/
├── utils/
└── schemas/
controllers/                   # High-level controllers
└── planning_agent/
    └── simple_agent.py
```

### 2. Import Updates
- Updated all imports from `orchestration_agent.*` to `orchestration_engine.*`
- Updated planning agent imports to use `controllers.planning_agent`
- Created proper `__init__.py` files with clean exports

### 3. Architecture Benefits
- **Separation of Concerns**: Engine vs. controllers have distinct responsibilities
- **Reusability**: Orchestration engine can be used by multiple controllers
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new controllers without modifying the engine
- **Maintainability**: Clear dependency flow and module boundaries

### 4. Dependency Flow
```
controllers/planning_agent/ → orchestration_engine/
```
The planning agent (controller) uses the orchestration engine, not the other way around.

## Files Created
- `orchestration_engine/__init__.py` - Main package exports
- `controllers/__init__.py` - Controllers package
- `controllers/planning_agent/__init__.py` - Planning agent exports
- `example_usage.py` - Usage demonstration
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Detailed architecture documentation
- `test_refactor.py` - Comprehensive test suite

## Verification
All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ Import structure works correctly
- ✅ Component initialization works
- ✅ Schema creation works
- ✅ Directory structure is correct
- ✅ Old structure cleaned up

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from orchestration_engine import OrchestratorCore, ConfigManager, ToolManager
from controllers.planning_agent import SimplePlanningAgent

# Initialize engine
config = ConfigManager.load_configuration()
tool_manager = ToolManager(config)
orchestrator_core = OrchestratorCore(config, tool_manager)

# Create controller
planning_agent = SimplePlanningAgent(orchestrator_core, client, model)

# Execute workflow
result = planning_agent.execute_plan(alert, context)
```

### Creating New Controllers
```python
from orchestration_engine import OrchestratorCore, ExecutionContext

class MyController:
    def __init__(self, orchestrator_core: OrchestratorCore):
        self.orchestrator_core = orchestrator_core
    
    def execute_workflow(self, inputs):
        context = ExecutionContext(...)
        return self.orchestrator_core.execute_with_context(context)
```

## Next Steps
1. Run `python example_usage.py` (with OPENAI_API_KEY set) to test the full workflow
2. Create additional controllers in the `controllers/` directory as needed
3. Always import from `orchestration_engine` in new controllers
4. Follow the established patterns for context and execution

## Migration Impact
- **Breaking Changes**: Any external code importing from `orchestration_agent` needs to be updated
- **Benefits**: Much cleaner architecture, easier to extend and maintain
- **Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved, just reorganized

The refactor successfully achieves the goal of creating a reusable orchestration engine that can be used by multiple high-level controllers, with the planning agent being the first example of this pattern.
